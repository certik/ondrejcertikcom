[{"categories":null,"contents":"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.\nOndřej started the project in 2005, and since then developed a large user and developer community. He handed over the leadership to Aaron Meurer in 2011.\nSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007 and Ondřej has been either a mentor or an organization admin (together with Aaron Meurer).

Start from the most general (and correct) physical theories (general relativity or standard model) and derive the specialized equations from them (e.g. the Schrödinger equation). Math is developed in the math section (not in the physics section). Theory should be presented as short and as explicitly as possible. Then there should be arbitrary number of examples, to show how the theory is used. There should be just one notation used throughout the book. It should serve as a reference to any physics equation (exact derivation where it comes from) and the reader should be able to understand how things work from this book, and be ready to understand specialized literature.  This is a work in progress and some chapters don’t conform to the above goals yet. Usually first some derivation is written, as we understood it, then the mathematical tools are extracted and put into the math section, and the rest is fit where it belongs. Sometimes we don’t understand some parts yet, then those are currently left there as they are.\nAt the page you can find html version of the book, source code, pdf and also order a physical hardcover book.\n","permalink":"https://ondrejcertik.com/projects/contributions/tfr/","tags":["Theoretical Physics","Book","Reference"],"title":"Theoretical Physics Reference"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Fortran 90 is a website which lists recommended practices for modern Fortran.
