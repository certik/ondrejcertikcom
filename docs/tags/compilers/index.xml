      <description>LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler built on top of LLVM. It can execute user&amp;rsquo;s code interactively to allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to binaries with the goal to run user&amp;rsquo;s code on modern architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
Ondřej started the project in 2017, and is working towards getting first users and developers. He plans to make it a successful open source projects just like SymPy or SymEngine.</description>

      <description>In December I left Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to join GSI Technology as a compiler developer.
I have spent about 8.5 years at LANL. Physics and computing have always been my passions, so I got a Master in theoretical physics in Czechia, and then Ph.D. in chemical physics in the U.S. LANL is a great place for computational physics. I met and worked with many amazing people. It has been intellectually very satisfying to work on the projects that I was able to help with and things to learn.</description>
