      <description>LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler built on top of LLVM. It can execute user&amp;rsquo;s code interactively to allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to binaries with the goal to run user&amp;rsquo;s code on modern architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
Ondřej started the project in 2017, and is working towards getting first users and developers. He plans to make it a successful open source projects just like SymPy or SymEngine.</description>

      <title>fastGPT: Faster than PyTorch in 300 lines of Fortran</title>

      <description>Authors: Ondřej Čertík, Brian Beckman
In this blog post I am announcing fastGPT, fast GPT-2 inference written in Fortran. In it, I show
  Fortran has speed at least as good as default PyTorch on Apple M1 Max.
  Fortran code has statically typed arrays, making maintenance of the code easier than with Python
  It seems that the bottleneck algorithm in GPT-2 inference is matrix-matrix multiplication. For physicists like us, matrix-matrix multiplication is very familiar, unlike other aspects of AI and ML.</description>

      <description>In December I left Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to join GSI Technology as a compiler developer.
I have spent about 8.5 years at LANL. Physics and computing have always been my passions, so I got a Master in theoretical physics in Czechia, and then Ph.D. in chemical physics in the U.S. LANL is a great place for computational physics. I met and worked with many amazing people. It has been intellectually very satisfying to work on the projects that I was able to help with and things to learn.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Fortran</title>

      <description>We have finished the first chapter on a long journey of resurrecting Fortran: forming an initial core community of developers and users with enough momentum around the new Fortran website and projects at fortran-lang.org. There is still have a long way to go to, but this was a necessary (although not sufficient) achievement and I feel this was a once in a life time event. The timing was right, we were ready, and we also got lucky.</description>

      <title>Running for WG5 Convenor Announcement</title>

      <description>I decided to run for WG5 Convenor (International Fortran Committee Chair). I have written up a Platform document that explains why I am running, the issues as I see them, and how I propose to work with the Committee to address them (see also my CV). I have developed this platform with many Fortran community members, both inside and outside of the Fortran Committee. Furthermore, I have also posted the platform as a GitHub repository and I encourage anyone to open issues and Pull Requests (PRs) to discuss and further refine the platform.</description>
