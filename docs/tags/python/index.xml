      <description>SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.
Ondřej started the project in 2005, and since then developed a large user and developer community. He handed over the leadership to Aaron Meurer in 2011.
SymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007 and Ondřej has been either a mentor or an organization admin (together with Aaron Meurer).</description>

      <description>In December I left Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to join GSI Technology as a compiler developer.
I have spent about 8.5 years at LANL. Physics and computing have always been my passions, so I got a Master in theoretical physics in Czechia, and then Ph.D. in chemical physics in the U.S. LANL is a great place for computational physics. I met and worked with many amazing people. It has been intellectually very satisfying to work on the projects that I was able to help with and things to learn.</description>
